# Miniforge

I recommend using [`miniforge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) as your environment manager.

On Unix systems (OSX, Linux, and WSL), [`miniforge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) can be installed in two simple steps.

1. `curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"`

2. `bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh`
