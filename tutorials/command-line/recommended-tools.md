# Recommended Tools

## `ripgrep`

[`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a better, faster `grep`.

## `eza`

Once you've used [`eza`](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) you won't want to use `ls` anymore. It's just that good.

## `bat`

[`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is `cat`, but with smart syntax highlighting. This is great for viewing code.

## `zoxide`

[`zoxide`](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) is a better version of `cd` that remembers your previous moves and speeds up navigation.

## `fzf`

[`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a fuzzy finder that helps you search for files and commands.

## `tmux`

If you spend a lot of time in the terminal then [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) is a must have. It allows you to quickly cycle through multiple sessions for streamlined development.

## `neovim`

`vim` is great, but if you're interested in customizing your editor, you should check out [`neovim`](https://neovim.io).

## `entr`

[`entr`](https://github.com/eradman/entr) is a useful tool for automating tests and updating code.
